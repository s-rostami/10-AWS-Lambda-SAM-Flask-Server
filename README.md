# SAM-Serverless-Application-Model-Example-1

The following services were created using SAM: Lambda, API gateway, Cognito Uaer Pool and client 

file "steps & commands.sh" defines the required steps to create the services. 

In this example , a DynamoDB table existed before creating the stack and the table name is alreday hardcoded in the "index.js" file which is the lambda handler.

The main intention of the example is to create a service with AWS API gateway and lambda and use postman to post data into the revelent dynamodb table.
